# PRODIGY_WD_03

This project is a responsive Tic Tac Toe game developed as part of my web development internship at Prodigy Infotech. The game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, features a user-friendly interface with real-time updates, animations, and sound effects. Designed to work seamlessly across various devices, it enhances the classic game experience with modern web development practices.
